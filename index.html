    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>My name is Louis Lozneanu and I am a 2nd year student at IIT. My major is in Applied Analytics and I am getting my minor in Artificial Intelligence. I do not live too far away from school so I usually commute across the exrepssway in order to attend my classes each semester.</p>
    
    <h2>Beliefs/Church</h2>
    <p>My belief and faith in Jesus Christ as the One true God and the only way into Heaven is what matters most to me and my indentity. I believe that the Bible is the Word of God. I am a member of Bethany Romanian Pentecostal Church and I serve there in many ways, including their brass band and orchestra (more about this in the music tab).</p>
